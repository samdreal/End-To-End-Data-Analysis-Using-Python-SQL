# End-To-End-Data-Analysis-Using-Python+ Sql

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow using Python and SQL. The goal is to showcase the entire process, from data extraction to analysis and generating insights to answer business questions.

## Workflow

## Data Extraction:
Exported a dataset from Kaggle using the Kaggle API directly into a Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Transformation:
Loaded the CSV data into a pandas DataFrame.
Performed various data cleaning and transformation tasks, such as handling missing values, converting data types, and feature engineering.

## Data Loading:
Loaded the transformed data into a MySQL database using SQLAlchemy.


## Data Analysis:
Conducted SQL queries to analyze the data stored in MySQL.
Answered several business-related questions using these queries, providing valuable insights.

## Key Components
Kaggle API: Used to download the dataset directly into the Jupyter Notebook.
Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and transformation.
SQLAlchemy: Facilitated the connection and interaction between Python and MySQL.
MySQL: Served as the database for storing and querying the cleaned data.
Jupyter Notebook: Provided an interactive environment for performing and documenting the analysis.

## Business Questions Answered
1.find top 10 highest reveue generating products 

2.find top 5 highest selling products in each region

3.find month over month growth comparison for 2022 and 2023 sales eg : jan 2022 vs jan 2023

4.for each category which month had highest sales 

5.which sub category had highest growth by profit in 2023 compare to 2022

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive example of how to perform data analysis from start to finish, utilizing both Python for data manipulation and SQL for database management and querying. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the integration of Python with SQL and demonstrates practical skills in data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
